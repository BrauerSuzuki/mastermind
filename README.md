# Mastermind
Mastermind is a popular board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). Solely for the purpose of learning Python (and git), I created this mastermind clone with a decent computer player. 
To start the program, run "python mastermind.py" from the command line.

In version 2 I have improved the computer player algorithm. It now uses Numpy arrays. This led to cleaner and slightly faster code and needs less memory.
