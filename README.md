# Mastermind
Mastermind is a popular board game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). Solely for the purpose of learning Python (and git), I created this mastermind clone with a decent computer player. 
To start the program, run "python mastermind.py" from the command line.

In version 2 I have improved the computer player algorithm. It now uses Numpy arrays. This led to cleaner and slightly faster code and needs less memory.

To run the game on your computer do the following steps:
1. Install a python environment.
2. Install the python packages PySimpleGUI, PIL, numpy. For instance, via "pip install".
3. Download "mastermind_v2.py" and the "colors" folder.
4. run "python mastermind_v2.py" on the command line.
